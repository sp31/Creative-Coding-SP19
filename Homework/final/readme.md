# Mad Math Cafe

Thank you for trying out Mad Math Cafe. Mad Math Cafe is an interactive sketch application created using p5.js and contains elements utilized from Creative Commons assets. This interactive application also utilizes the p5.sound and p5.SoundFile library to help create a cafe experience.

In this game, you are playing the role of a barista. Your purpose is to use quick, mental math to realize how many parts of of a drink you have, how many parts of the missing ingredient you need, and to calculate it all within a specified amount of time.

Users should take note of the time limit per drink, or risk upsetting the customer and having to move on to the next customer's order. Pay close attention to the manager's notes for tips as wel.
