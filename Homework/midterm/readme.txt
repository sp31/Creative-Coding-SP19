Mystery City

Thank you for accessing Mystery City. Mystery City is an interactive sketch application created using p5.js and contains elements utilized from Creative Commons assets.

In this game, you are visiting a city that places you in the middle of a mystery - your life is at risk and you must escape by finding the tools (clues) to get you out.

Users should use the flashlight (cursor) to search the scenes in each stage before proceeding to the next stage and finally escaping Mystery City.
